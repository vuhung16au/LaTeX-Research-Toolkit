\textit{This section will cover probabilistic interpretation of principal component analysis.}

\section{Factor Analysis}

\textit{This section will introduce factor analysis and its relationship to PCA.}

\section{Independent Component Analysis}

\textit{This section will discuss ICA and blind source separation.}
