\section{Comparison with Deep Learning}
\label{sec:comparison}

Classical methods have limitations that deep learning addresses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Feature engineering:} Classical methods require manual feature design; deep learning learns features automatically
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} Deep learning scales better with data and model size
    \item \textbf{Representation:} Deep networks learn hierarchical representations
    \item \textbf{Flexibility:} Deep learning handles diverse data types (images, text, audio)
\end{itemize}

However, classical methods remain valuable:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simpler to interpret and debug
    \item Effective for small to medium datasets
    \item Lower computational requirements
    \item Strong theoretical guarantees in some cases
\end{itemize}
