% Chapter 10: Sequence Modeling: Recurrent and Recursive Nets

\chapter{Sequence Modeling: Recurrent and Recursive Nets}
\label{chap:sequence-modeling}

This chapter covers architectures designed for sequential and temporal data, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants.

\section{Recurrent Neural Networks}

\textit{This section will introduce basic RNN architecture and forward propagation.}

\section{Backpropagation Through Time}

\textit{This section will explain gradient computation for RNNs.}

\section{Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)}

\textit{This section will cover LSTM architecture and gating mechanisms.}

\section{Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)}

\textit{This section will introduce GRU as a simpler alternative to LSTM.}

\section{Sequence-to-Sequence Models}

\textit{This section will discuss encoder-decoder architectures and attention mechanisms.}
