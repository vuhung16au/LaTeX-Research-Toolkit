% Chapter 3: Probability and Information Theory

\chapter{Probability and Information Theory}
\label{chap:probability}

This chapter introduces fundamental concepts from probability theory and information theory that are essential for understanding machine learning and deep learning. Topics include probability distributions, conditional probability, expectation, variance, entropy, and mutual information.

\section{Probability Distributions}

\textit{This section will cover discrete and continuous probability distributions, including common distributions used in deep learning.}

\section{Conditional Probability and Bayes' Rule}

\textit{This section will discuss conditional probability, independence, and Bayes' theorem.}

\section{Expectation, Variance, and Covariance}

\textit{This section will introduce key statistical measures and their properties.}

\section{Common Probability Distributions}

\textit{This section will cover Gaussian, Bernoulli, categorical, and other distributions commonly used in deep learning.}

\section{Information Theory Basics}

\textit{This section will introduce entropy, cross-entropy, KL divergence, and mutual information.}
