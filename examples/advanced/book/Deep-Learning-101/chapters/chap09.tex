% Chapter 9: Convolutional Networks

\chapter{Convolutional Networks}
\label{chap:convolutional-networks}

This chapter introduces convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are particularly effective for processing grid-structured data like images.

\section{The Convolution Operation}

\textit{This section will explain convolution and its properties.}

\section{Pooling}

\textit{This section will cover max pooling, average pooling, and other pooling operations.}

\section{CNN Architectures}

\textit{This section will discuss classic architectures: LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, etc.}

\section{Applications of CNNs}

\textit{This section will explore image classification, object detection, and segmentation.}
