\section{What is Deep Learning?}
\label{sec:what-is-dl}
\difficulty{beginner}

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on learning hierarchical representations of data through artificial \gls{neural-network}s with multiple layers. These networks, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, have revolutionized numerous fields including \gls{computer-vision}, \gls{natural-language-processing}, speech recognition, and many others.

\subsection{The Rise of Deep Learning}

The resurgence of neural networks, now known as deep learning, can be attributed to several key factors:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Availability of Large Datasets:} The digital age has produced massive amounts of data, providing the fuel needed to train complex models effectively.
    
    \item \textbf{Computational Power:} The advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and specialized hardware has enabled the training of much larger networks than was previously possible.
    
    \item \textbf{Algorithmic Innovations:} Improvements in optimization algorithms, regularization techniques, and network architectures have made it possible to train very deep networks.
    
    \item \textbf{Open-Source Software:} Frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others have democratized access to deep learning tools.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Key Characteristics}

Deep learning differs from traditional machine learning in several important ways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Automatic Feature Learning:} Unlike traditional approaches that require manual feature engineering, deep learning models automatically learn relevant features from raw data.
    
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical Representations:} Deep networks learn multiple levels of representation, from low-level features (e.g., edges in images) to high-level concepts (e.g., object categories).
    
    \item \textbf{End-to-End Learning:} Deep learning often enables end-to-end learning, where the entire system is trained jointly rather than in separate stages.
    
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} Deep learning models can continue to improve with more data and computational resources.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applications}

Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in numerous domains:

\begin{description}
    \item[Computer Vision:] Image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, facial recognition, and image generation.
    
    \item[Natural Language Processing:] Machine translation, sentiment analysis, question answering, text generation, and language understanding.
    
    \item[Speech and Audio:] Speech recognition, speaker identification, music generation, and audio synthesis.
    
    \item[Healthcare:] Medical image analysis, drug discovery, disease prediction, and personalized medicine.
    
    \item[Robotics:] Autonomous navigation, manipulation, and decision-making.
    
    \item[Game Playing:] Achieving superhuman performance in complex games like Go, Chess, and video games.
\end{description}

The impact of deep learning extends far beyond these applications, touching virtually every aspect of modern technology and scientific research.
