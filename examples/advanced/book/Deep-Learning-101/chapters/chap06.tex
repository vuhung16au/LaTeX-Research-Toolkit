% Chapter 6: Deep Feedforward Networks

\chapter{Deep Feedforward Networks}
\label{chap:feedforward-networks}

This chapter introduces deep feedforward neural networks, also known as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). These are the fundamental building blocks of deep learning.

\section{Introduction to Feedforward Networks}

\textit{This section will introduce the basic architecture and forward propagation.}

\section{Activation Functions}

\textit{This section will cover sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, and other activation functions.}

\section{Output Units and Loss Functions}

\textit{This section will discuss output layer design for different tasks.}

\section{Backpropagation}

\textit{This section will explain the backpropagation algorithm for computing gradients.}

\section{Universal Approximation}

\textit{This section will discuss the theoretical capacity of neural networks.}
