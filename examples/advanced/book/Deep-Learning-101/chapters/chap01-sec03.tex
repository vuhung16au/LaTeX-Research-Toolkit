\section{Fundamental Concepts}
\label{sec:fundamental-concepts}

Before diving into the technical details, it is essential to understand several fundamental concepts that underpin deep learning.

\subsection{Learning from Data}

At its core, deep learning is about learning from data. Given a dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(\vect{x}_1, y_1), (\vect{x}_2, y_2), \ldots, (\vect{x}_n, y_n)\}$, where $\vect{x}_i$ represents input features and $y_i$ represents corresponding targets, the goal is to learn a function $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ that maps inputs to outputs.

\begin{definition}[Supervised Learning]
In supervised learning, we have access to labeled examples where both inputs and desired outputs are known. The model learns to predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Unsupervised Learning]
In unsupervised learning, we only have inputs without explicit labels. The model learns to discover patterns, structure, or representations in the data.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Reinforcement Learning]
In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
\end{definition}

\subsection{The Learning Process}

The learning process in deep learning typically involves:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Model Definition:} Specify the architecture of the neural network, including the number of layers, types of layers, and activation functions.
    
    \item \textbf{Loss Function:} Define a loss function $\mathcal{L}(\hat{y}, y)$ that measures the discrepancy between predictions $\hat{y}$ and true targets $y$.
    
    \item \textbf{Optimization:} Use an optimization algorithm (typically gradient descent variants) to adjust the model parameters $\vect{\theta}$ to minimize the loss:
    \begin{equation}
        \vect{\theta}^* = \arg\min_{\vect{\theta}} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathcal{L}(f(\vect{x}_i; \vect{\theta}), y_i)
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Evaluation:} Assess the model's performance on held-out test data to estimate generalization.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Neural Networks as Universal Approximators}

One of the remarkable properties of neural networks is their ability to approximate a wide range of functions.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Approximation Theorem (informal)]
A neural network with a single hidden layer containing a sufficient number of neurons can approximate any continuous function on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ to arbitrary accuracy.
\end{theorem}

While this theorem provides theoretical justification for using neural networks, in practice, deep networks with multiple layers are often more efficient and effective than shallow but wide networks.

\subsection{Representation Learning}

A key advantage of deep learning is automatic feature learning, also known as representation learning.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lower Layers:} Learn simple, general features (e.g., edges, textures in images)
    \item \textbf{Middle Layers:} Combine simple features into more complex patterns (e.g., object parts)
    \item \textbf{Higher Layers:} Learn abstract, task-specific representations (e.g., object categories)
\end{itemize}

This hierarchical feature learning is what makes deep networks particularly powerful for complex tasks.

\subsection{Generalization and Overfitting}

A critical challenge in machine learning is ensuring that models generalize well to new data.

\begin{definition}[Overfitting]
Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and spurious patterns, leading to poor performance on new data.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Underfitting]
Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data.
\end{definition}

The goal is to find the right balance between model complexity and generalization ability, often visualized by the bias-variance tradeoff:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Expected Error} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \text{Irreducible Error}
\end{equation}

Understanding these fundamental concepts provides a solid foundation for exploring the technical details of deep learning in subsequent chapters.
